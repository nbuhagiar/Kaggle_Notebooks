We must find a way to extract features from these messages so as to be able to train a machine learning model that can identify a spam message. One thing we can do is extract the subject matter of these messages using topic modelling. A topic model is an unsupervised machine learning model that can be trained on a corpus (a collection of documents) to identify the topics within those documents. In this context, a topic is usually defined as a probability distribution of all terms in the corpus vocabulary appearing for that given topic.\n\nOne popular topic model is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Training an LDA model on our training data, we can use this model to represent messages as topic weight vectors, where the value in each element of the topic weight vector corresponds to the weight in which that given message exhibits the associated topic. One caveat with using LDA however is that one must preemptively set the number of topics believed to be exhibited in a corpus prior to training an LDA model on it. Using the topic modelling package Gensim, we will train an LDA model on the training set, and use this LDA model to transform the train and test set into topic weight vectors. We will use the Gensim default of 100 topics for this task.\n\nSince more meaning can sometimes be derived from words when taken together instead of individually (i.e. 'see you later' as opposed to the individual terms 'see', 'you' and 'later') we will take into consideration not just individual terms, but collections of terms (also known as n-grams). We will take into consideration n-grams with n equal to 1, 2, and 3 (also known as unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams respectively). All English stop words (i.e. the, and, etc.) will be ignored, offering no useful information with regards to the subject matter of these messages. For simplicity, when using the LDA model to transform messages into topic vectors, any topics that have a probability less than 0.01 of being exhibited by that message will automatically have their topic weight set to zero for that message.\n\nLet's now build this topic model, and use it to transform our train and test data, taking a peek at the modified training data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b0ab362ee8799eaf9788c8592c7ee65f88457fa1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words=\"english\", \n                             ngram_range=(1, 3))\nterm_document_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(train.Message)\ncorpus = Sparse2Corpus(term_document_matrix, documents_columns=False)\nid2word = {value: key for key, value in vectorizer.vocabulary_.items()}\nmodel = LdaModel(corpus=corpus, \n                 id2word=id2word, \n                 random_state=0)\n\ndef transform_messages_to_topic_vectors(data, vectorizer, model):\n    num_topics = model.num_topics\n    message_topics = pd.DataFrame(index=map(str, range(num_topics)))    \n    for index, message in data.Message.iteritems():\n        message_transformed = (vectorizer.transform([message]))\n        message_corpus = (Sparse2Corpus(message_transformed, documents_columns=False))\n        topics_framework = dict.fromkeys(map(str, range(0, num_topics)))\n        topics_specific = dict(list(model[message_corpus])[0])\n        for key in topics_specific:\n            topics_framework[str(key)] = topics_specific[key]\n        message_topics[index] = pd.Series(topics_framework)\n    message_topics = message_topics.T.fillna(0)\n    data = data.join(message_topics)\n    data.drop(\"Message\", axis=1, inplace=True)\n    data = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)\n    data.rename(columns=dict(Class_spam=\"Spam\"), inplace=True)\n    return data\n\ntrain = transform_messages_to_topic_vectors(train, vectorizer, model)\ntest = transform_messages_to_topic_vectors(test, vectorizer, model)\ntrain.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"55c41b6959d96aa150a4846521161f0780daddb3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Viewing our transformed training data, we can see that the topic weight vectors representing the messages is sparse.

Though all performed better than the dummy classifier with regards to their average precision score, the naive Bayes classifier still performed the worst. The SVM with an RBF kernel performed the best out of all individual machine learning models with an average precision score of 0.584, but applying an emsemble of all these machine learning models had the highest overall average precision score of 0.625. Let's view a confusion matrix of the test predictions made by this voting classifier to gather additional insight into its performance."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5542a4e874437318df7b62bd3564729df507a192"},"cell_type":"code","source":"confusion = pd.DataFrame(confusion_matrix(Y_test, ensemble_preds))\nconfusion = confusion.div(confusion.sum().sum())\nconfusion.columns = [\"Predicted Negative\", \"Predicted Positive\"]\nconfusion.index = [\"Actual Negative\", \"Actual Positive\"]\nax = sns.heatmap(confusion, vmin=0, vmax=1, annot=True, fmt=\".0%\")\nax.set_yticklabels(ax.get_yticklabels(), rotation=0)\nax.collections[0].colorbar.set_ticks((0, .25, .5, .75, 1))\nax.collections[0].colorbar.set_ticklabels((\"0%\", \"25%\", \"50%\", \"75%\", \"100%\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"03c951eaf01890b4635320cd66ae3a69aac7f642"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Despite this satisfactory performance, around 2% of the messages in the test set were identifed as spam when they actually weren't.
